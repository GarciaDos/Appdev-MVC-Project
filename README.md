OUTDATED!! (will put it up just in case you download the .zip on the green code button download)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###Please do note that once you have downloaded the zip, and opened it you will encounter a folder which is named after my repository name and inside it will be another zip file which contains my original
zipped folder.

When you extract the folder please do mind not to close the rar file of Appdev-MVC-Project when accessing the AppDevNew.7zip since it will break the operation.

###The AppDevNew folder will be the desired file in order to access my website

Hello professor due to uploading the folder inside the repository causes folder system to get jumbled I have decided to zip up the folder and upload it directly to the repository instead

UPDATED GUIDELINE
Please click the AppDevNew.7z then click the download button, in order to download the raw file (so you wont have double zip file inside)

Open the project "AppDevNew" in your preferred IDE 

Open your terminal 

input "cd demo" and enter

input "python.exe manage.py runserver" and enter

click and open "127.0.0.1:8000" link in the terminal

The website will now be opened on your main browser

Please do enjoy browsing my website!!

### If you want to find the other github I made, here is the link: https://github.com/GarciaDos/AppDev-MVC 

Please do note that i'm having trouble recreating what I have done on my instructions in my readme, that's why I made this zipped repository instead
